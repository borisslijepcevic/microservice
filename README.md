# microservice
This is my first microservice application. I am using Spring boot and Maven. Created complete user registration with email validation by using confirmation token.
Added bcrypt with Spring security. 
Need to create hotels, rooms, and much more.

NOT FINISHED, because I want to make full stack project first and working on that right now.
I am desided to do this project from a start, because I am not used commits and I am made some mistakes that is not good for programming (added default admin, dispose
many things that I shouldn't etc. I will erase this project and make better one.
